This repository is for college module Enhanced Placement Engineering Portfolio [ME4336]

I am a third year mechatronic engineering student in University of Limerick (See crest above). I am currently on placement in Hollister ULC, Ballina plant, as a Student Controls Engineer. I am focussing largely on robotics, PLC ladder code and Ignition SCADA systems, gaining great insight and knowledge into these fields. Throughout this placement I am also keeping my college education flowing by undertaking online modules throughout the semester, teaching me about things such as Lean Tools and Critical thinking, but also more pratical topics such as Robotic Systems and Cyber Security. The module I am creating this repository is called "Enhanced Placement Engineering Portfolio 2". This module requires me to keep a portfolio of my placement for the second semester of this year, consisting of work logs and project updates along with more liberal doccuments relating to my time on placement.

## Placement Experience Overview

| Time Range | Focus Site | Result |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Month 1 (March) | PFS2 Page | Create waste site documenting waste on PFS2 |
| Month 2 (April) | CAM CELL Page | Create pages showing OEE and losses on CAM Cell |
| Month 3 (May) | PFS5, PFS2, CAM CELL | Testing and refinement of all sites |

## Project Key Notes

1. PFS2 Site
   - Focussing on waste
   - Ensuring that data is accurate
   - TA and spiking reasons.
   - Identify causes of waste spiking, audit trail to suggest edits.

2. CAM Cell
   - Isolated pages along with individual OEE's
   - Perfect one and copy and paste
   - Accumulated OEE and metrics for cell. highest costs to OEE

3. Testing/Refinement/Upgrades
   - OEE/Data/Metric Editing
   - Login services
   - Ensure data being calculated is correct and accurate
   - any bugs - null last error on full error log.
